__doc__ = """
This is a mock package to generate `pdoc` documentation for the LVGL UI Generator v2 project.

The mock package contains mock objects for the `jpeg`, `lvgl`, and `display` modules.

These mock objects are used to circumvent the `ImportError` that occurs when importing these unknown modules in a non-MicroPython environment.

None of these objects are actually real, and are only used for documentation purposes.

In the future, these mock objects may be extended to include further documentation regarding the aforementioned modules.
